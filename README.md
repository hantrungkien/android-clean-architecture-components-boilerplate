# Android Clean Architecture Components Boilerplate

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ I hope this boilerplate is not only helpful to other developers, but also that it helps to educate in the area of architecture. I created this boilerplate for a few reasons:

1. To experiment with modularisation
2. To experiment with the Android Architecture Components
3. To share some approaches to clean architecture, especially as we've been [talking a lot about it](https://academy.realm.io/posts/converting-an-app-to-use-clean-architecture/)
4. To use as a starting point in future projects where clean architecture feels appropriate

### Disclaimer

Note: The use of clean architecture may seem over-complicated for this sample project. However, this allows us to keep the amount of boilerplate code to a minimum and also demonstrate the approach in a simpler form.

Clean Architecture will not be appropriate for every project, so it is down to you to decide whether or not it fits your needs.

## Languages, libraries and tools used

* [Android Architecture Components ( Room, LiveModel, Livedata)](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/index.html)
* Android Support Libraries
* [RxJava2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/What's-different-in-2.0)
* [Dagger 2 (2.15)](https://github.com/google/dagger)
* [Glide](https://github.com/bumptech/glide)
* [Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/)
* [AutoDimension](https://github.com/hantrungkien/AutoDimension)

## Architecture

The architecture of the project follows the principles of Clean Architecture. Here's how the sample project implements it:

## Conclusion

Again to note, use Clean Architecture where appropriate. That decision is down to you and the project that you are working on.
